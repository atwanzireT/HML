                            Many of our international visitors will of course be in an awe
                            struck with the views of the Rwenzori whilst they prepare mentally for their own assault on
                            the mountain. Our terrace is, of course, the ideal venue for a Rwenzori sun-downer before
                            proceeding to our restaurant for a sumptuous meal. You wonâ€™t find a better meal in Kasese
                            and environs than in our restaurant. Our hand picked chefs will prepare for you a gourmet
                            meal served in our comfortable restaurant. You can also enjoy some quiet moments in the
                            gardens. Hotel Margherita attends to her Guests with courtesy and warm hospitality that
                            makes them feel part of the entire Rwenzori experience.
